The design of this page was built by me in Figma.It is my first project created there  which learnt me some essentials tips of how to work in its environment.
Despite of me not having propper knowledge in UI/UX design, this was a good tutorial to get used to some of the concepts like the difference between svg icons and .jpg phots,
color wheel and some of the websites where i could find high quality photots and get inspirations .
